## About the project
This project was made during KPMG virtual internship for a bicycle company for them to understand their customers better and find new customers based on that.
<br>
**Tools used: Excel, PowerPoint, Power BI**<br><br>
Process followed:
* Data quality assessment in Excel: The raw data provided had many inconsistencies like incompleteness, accuracy, relevancy, duplicate data, etc. that needed to be corrected.
* Finding insights: After preparing data, some insights were drawn from it like finding high-value customers based on their location, job type, age, etc. RFM method was used for this.
* Visualising the data using Power BI
